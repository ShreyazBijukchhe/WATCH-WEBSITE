              Though it is has impacted positively in our lives, it also has
              several drawbacks. Throughout use of heavy machines and
              technologies has greatly impacted in the environment and
              ecosystem. Technologies has caused different pollutions and
              degrade the natural resources. Uncontrolled use of it may cause
              the extinct in species. Many industries and companies now use
              robots and AI's to do the task. This has cause growth in
              unemployment rate. In April 2024, approximately 800 job cuts in
              the U.S. were attributed directly to AI advancements, marking the
              highest monthly total since May 2023. Another thing is that as
              many people are globally connected using internet, it has given
              birth to cyber crime. Some people may not have the access of new
              technologies which has resulted them untouched about current
              affairs. And those who have access to electrical devices like
              laptops, mobiles they are facing eye problems due to continuous
              staring at it. Many students rely on AI to solve the problem do
              the HomeWorks which has made their minds dull. Real life
              communication is neglected these days as we can reach people just
              by sitting in our house. This has affected our culture as well.
              But obviously we can control it by using them wisely and properly.
